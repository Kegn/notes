## successful launch with no product and no money and no customers

### finding a market

1. start on the consulting side of things

2. build **funnels** - automated sequences that get customers to buy

	Good funnel properties:
	 - desireable product/service to sell
	 - good sales copy for your offer
	 - method of collecting payment, e.g. a checkout page
	 - one-click sequence for upselling and **downselling** - the art of narrowing customer expectations and matching them with a solution that meets needs/desires
*note* - downselling is extremely important, if not **more** important than upselling.


## tapping the breaks (no, not brakes)

3. make a **greenlight framework** to fight **the resistance**
	greenlight framework 
	    criteria must be met before moving on
			1. [ Y / N ] is there a demand for the product. How do you know?
			2. [ Y / N ] is there a competitor?
			3. [ Y / N ] will someone pay for it right now?
	
			to answer the above: (sample)
			  1 - check forum activity. are there active threads? Can I easily find people trying to solve the issue my product will solve?
### full example : greenlight framework for 'One-Click Upsells'
	1. Demand
		-   WooCommerce forums
		-   WooCommerce facebook groups
		-   various google groups
		These items led us to MORE people looking for a solution to the problem we were solving
		These were real people we could talk to and gain insight
		That aside, *how much actual demand was there?*
	
	2. Competitor
	    - You want this to be yes. If other people saw a need and were compelled to fix the problem, you have selected an issue worth solving
		- If there is no competition, why?
				- you probably are looking in the wrong spot. Original ideas are a lot more rare than we'd like to believe
		- with One-Click, there was no direct competitor serving WooCommerce. However, the product did exist for other platforms, so the concept of 'One-Click' was not completely alien
				- we looked at SamCart, ClickFunnels, etc.
	3. Will someone pay for it RIGHT NOW?
		- if this one does not pass, drop it and run. Consider that at that point, you have failed, and you are now wasting time.

This is the **hardest** part
		- there are two schools of thought on this:
			a) pre-sell
			b) build barebones, sell as MVP (minimum viable product)
	Here is what we did:
	 - found active forum thread
	 - announced we were going to build the product/solution
	 - setup simple landing-page / opt-in form that asked people to signup if they were interested in beta
				ayoo, 35 people signed up
	 - with our list, we did some segmentation
	      how many of these people were successful in (the field the product exists in) WooCommerce?
				about 10
     - we needed to know what to offer on Day #1
			our theory : build a product 6-7figure businesses can use to achieve measurable results
	 - but, we still needed to know if they would pay. 
			so we took our list and hammered out the basics
			then we sold it at a large discount to customer #1
	 - everyone paid

	 ** What i wish ** i had done 
			ask for money up front. This will allow you to better guage how excited your audience is
	
	4. The Launch
		- gather feedback, improve
		- get to 'ok this feels goodish' 
		We then put together a sales page that
			a) educated potential clients on the prospects of the value of using the product
			b) housed testimonials from our beta testers
			c) included demo of product, video sales-letter (top of page) and special discount for first 100 customers

		To increase / drive traffic, we 
			- went back to the forums that we announced the produc
			- went back to facebook groups
			- we reached out to bloggers in the (parent field) Wordpress community and asked them to write reviews of our product
			- we used facebook retarrgeting (profitable!) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting

## Summary and tips

tips:
- be more protective of your time than you think you should be
- be ruthlessly honest with yourself. Kill ideas quickly if necessary
- practice getting excited about peple saying "NO"
    the best is when they say no when refusing to pre-purchase your product
- DO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR IDEAS. 
- fall in love with solving your customer-base's problems
- Things you dont need **when starting**
	- company name
	- logo
	- website
	- email list
	- other products

### comments of readers
 - having a marketbase / existing market to sell/promote the product will help bootstrap and scale
