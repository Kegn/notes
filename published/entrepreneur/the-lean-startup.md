# How can we build a sustainable organization around a new set of products or services?

	-   can it even be built? 
This is most often the response.
Instead, let's ask:
	-   *should* it even be built?

In this book, Eric's goal of innovation is:
  
""" To learn that which is currently unknown """

It it not:
  - efficiently or quick;y build something to see what happens, simply because we can.

## Learn
by failing. 
your organization must accept and promote failure as a valid outcome
the biggest waste is not knowing *when* something is a failure

## Do work that leads you to learn about what does and does not work
  successful people can often tell you more about what does not work than what does work


## Measuring Progress
 **Important**
	early startups : acheive as much validated learning as fast as possible. 
	*The means by which a team is held accountable for progress in validated learning is through innovation accounting*
 Innovation Accounting allows a team to:
	- build models of customer behavior
	- use built model to change customer behavior
	- establish facts / validity of the vision, along with its sustainability
 The three major milestones in innovation accounting are:
	- **Build** an MVP (minimum viable product) **and establish** a baseline and feedback loop with customers
	- **Experiment** on MVP to move from baseline behaviors to ideal consumer behaviors
	- **Decide** whether to preserve or pivot on lessons learned
 *primary engine for learning process* - Build-Measure-Learn loop

 Three techniques Eric hits on regarding moving through engine loop:
	1. Continuous deployment	-	deploy in small batches to production with smallest possible gaps for more feedback (which also will now come in small batches)
	2. Falsifiable hypothesis	-	create predictions for each change that can be tested / proven true or false
	3. Actionable Metrics		-   focus on a small set of well-defined metrics to measure. Deliver them to entire team as simply as possible, with comprehension for everyone in mind

 Eric notes that **teams should** :
	- use cohort analysis
	- use A/B testing
	- Measure people and their actions (vanity metrics do not do this)
	When decideding *how* to report findings, Eric notes:

		"""		For a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear cause and effect	"""
