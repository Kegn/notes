Semantic primes are by definition universal and primitive. They are universal in the fact that 
they can be translated literally into any known language and will still have the same semantic 
representation. They are primitive in that most of them are abstract, and all of them are 
"indefinable" because they cannot be defined using only other primes.[1]

Proponents of the NSM theory argue that every language on the globe shares a core vocabulary of 
concepts. In 1994 and 2002, Goddard and Wierzbicka studied languages across the globe and found 
strong evidence supporting this argument.[1]
Wierzbicka's 1972 study proposed 14 semantic primes. That number was expanded to 60 in 2002 by 
Wierzbicka and Goddard, and the current agreed-upon number is 63, as put forth by Goddard in 
2010.[1]
Each language's translations of the semantic primes are called exponents. Below is a list of 
English exponents, or the English translation of the semantic primitives. It is very important 
to realize that some of the exponents in the following list can be associated with meanings in 
English that are not shared with other languages. However, when used as an exponent in the 
Natural Semantic Metalanguage, we are only concerned with the meanings that are universal.
