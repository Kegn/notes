Universal grammar (UG) in linguistics, is the theory of the genetic component of the language 
faculty, usually credited to Noam Chomsky. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of 
structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience. With more linguistic 
stimuli received in the course of psychological development, children then adopt specific 
syntactic rules that conform to UG.[1] It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands 
contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. prescriptive, descriptive and pedagogical.[2][3] The 
advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on the poverty of the stimulus (POS) 
argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural human languages. However, the 
latter has especially not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are 
so diverse that such universality is rare.[4] It is a matter of empirical investigation to 
determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.
